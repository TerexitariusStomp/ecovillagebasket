[Create an NFT on Charged Particles.](https://docs.charged.fi/getting-started/quick-start)

**2nd Step**

*note if the ecovillage tokens are nonfungible then a bond can be created in a similar fashion.

**3rd Step**
[List the NFT for sale on Opensea](https://support.opensea.io/en/articles/8867002-how-do-i-sell-an-nft).
